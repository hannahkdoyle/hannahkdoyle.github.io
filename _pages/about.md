I am a first year PhD student at UC Berkeley studying human color vision and working on novel display technologies. Before coming to Berkeley for graduate school, I went to [Cornell University](https://observatory.colgate.edu/) in Ithaca, New York, where I worked with lasers in [Peter McMahon's Lab](https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/) and guided for a wonderful program called [Outdoor Odyssey](https://scl.cornell.edu/coe/odyssey). I also spent some time at [The Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/) working on optical reservoir computing. 

In my free time I like to do arts and crafts. Check out my [embroidery](https://hannahkdoyle.github.io/embroidery/) :)
